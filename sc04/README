	Formatting
		Messages, and individual words, can be formatted using JavaFX CSS.
		
		To format a message, input the format string between two apostrophes
			'<format>'
		and follow this by your message between two hashes
			'<format>'#<message>
		Spaces must be replaced with underscores.
		Messages must not contain apostrophes.
		
		Some examples of formatting to try are:
			'-fx-font-size:100'#Hello!#
			'-fx-font-size:40;-fx-font-weight:bold;-fx-fill:red'#Whats_up?#
			'-fx-font-size:100;-fx-fill:_linear-gradient(from_0%_0%_to_100%_200%,_repeat,_aqua_0%,_red_50%)'#Hi_There!#
