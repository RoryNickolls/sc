Multi-threaded application that allows multiple clients to connect with each other and send messages via a server.

Server instructions
	Simply run the server and leave it. Everything should appear in the server console.
	
Client instructions
	Run the client. Input your name in the alias box.
	Input the address and port of the server you want to connect to, and then press join server; the client will notify you if the connection was successful.
	Type in the message field and press send to send messages. Close the client to disconnect.
	
	Formatting
		Messages, and individual words, can be formatted using JavaFX CSS.
		
		To format a message, input the format string between two mews (alt 230)
			µ<format>µ
		and follow this by your message between two betas (alt 225)
			µ<format>µß<message>ß
		Spaces must be replaced with underscores.
		
		Some examples of formatting to try are:
			µ-fx-font-size:100µßHello!ß
			µ-fx-font-size:40;-fx-font-weight:bold;-fx-fill:redµßWhats_up?ß
			µ-fx-font-size:100;-fx-fill:_linear-gradient(from_0%_0%_to_100%_200%,_repeat,_aqua_0%,_red_50%)µßHi_There!ß
			
	Private Messaging
		You can private message another client. These messages will not show up in the server console, and will only show for you and the recipient.
		To do this, type
			/msg <recipient> <message>
		For example,
			/msg Cadet1 Hello cadet! How are you?
		<recipient> should be the alias of another client connected to the server.
		
	Memes
		To send a random cat meme, type /catmeme and then press send.
		To send your own memes or images, your message must take this format:
			<optional_msg>[img]<link>
		For example,
			Hey guys look at this meme! [img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrxldzOzEG1r3qoego1_400.gif
		Or
			µ-fx-font-size:50µßLOOK_AT_THIS_MEME!ß [img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrxldzOzEG1r3qoego1_400.gif
